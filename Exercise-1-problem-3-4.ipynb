    "A very common task handled by GIS is to convert a list of coordinates into geographic objects. For instance, you might have a table with latitude and longitude values, and want to use the locations in a map.\n",
    "Python is an excellent tool for this kind of a task: it can read data from (almost) any input format (CSV, text, Excel, GPX, various databases).\n",

    "In this exercise, we concentrate on reading data using [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), and on creating geometry objects using [shapely](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/). \n",
