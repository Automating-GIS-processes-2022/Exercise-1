# Exercise 1: Working with Geometric Objects

This week we will practice how to create geometric objects using
[shapely](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/) in Python.

In this exercise, you will also need to apply your skills from the [Geo-Python
course](https://geo-python.github.io). In the first set of problems (1-2) you
will define your own functions for handling geometric objects. In the second set
of problems (3-4), you will read in data from a file using
[pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) and create
geometries based on coordinate information in the input data. 


- **Exercise 1 is due by Tuesday, 8 November 2022, 3 pm**.

- Scores on this exercise are out of **20 points**.

## Notes

#### Solution code cells
You can always start working by removing this line of comment: 

```
# ADD YOUR CODE HERE

```

We are checking your solutions semi-automatically using
[nbgrader](https://nbgrader.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html#) which is a
package for creating and grading assingments in Jupyter Notebooks. Please use
the suggested variable names when writing your code so that our hidden tests
work smoothly :)

#### Non-editable code cells
Some of the code-cells are ‘non-editable’ which means that you are supposed to
run them, but you are not able to edit them. These non-editable code cells
should help you test your code while you proceed.
